Section 1: Week 11 Reflection
Answer each prompt with 3‚Äì5 bullet points:
‚Ä¢	Key Takeaways: What did you learn about capstone goals an expectation?
o	I learnt the technical requirements for the project
‚Ä¢	Concept Connections: Which Week 1‚Äì10 skills feel strongest? Which needs more practice?
o	I feel confident about all the skills learnt ‚Äì except the machine learning. I do not think it is possible to create any accurate forecast without access to more data. The data available from the free open weather api is limited.
‚Ä¢	Early Challenges: Any blockers (e.g., API keys, folder setup)? None
‚Ä¢	Support Strategies: Which office hours or resources can help you move forward? I will use office hours as needed.

Section 2: Feature Selection Rationale
List three features + one enhancement you plan to build.
‚óè	Weather History Tracker ‚Äì Save daily weather to a CSV file and display the last 7 days. (The difficulty level for this feature is listed as one star. I chose this feature because it is essential information for a weather app a building block for other features.)
‚óè	Temperature Graph ‚Äì Show a line graph of temperature over time using matplotlib (The difficulty level of this feature is listed as two stars I chose this feature because if 
‚óè	Weather Icons ‚Äì Use canvas graphics to visually represent weather (e.g., sun, clouds)

15	Feature 3	Polish UI	Error passing	Refactor	All features complete
16	Enhancement	Docs	Tests	Packaging	Ready-to-ship app
17	Rehearse	Buffer	Showcase	‚Äì	Demo Day


 Section 6: Risk Assessment
Identify at least 3 potential risks and how you‚Äôll handle them.
Risk	Likelihood (High/Med/Low)	Impact (High/Med/Low)	Mitigation Plan

1. Code breaks as I seek to add features
    Solution: create copies as a move forwards so I always have a working copy
2. Limited API Calls
    Solution: Save the data as calls are being made
    Solution: Use data saved locally
    Solution: error messages stating that API unavailable
    Solution: User another email address to have multiple free accounts
3. Internet not working or slow
    Solution: error message/progress bar
